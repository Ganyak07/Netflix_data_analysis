## Introduction
Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project! In this project,  the Netflix dataset was explored to investigate whether the average duration of movies has been declining over time. This project will utilize Python for data analysis and visualization to draw insights from the data.

## Dataset
The dataset (`netflix_data.csv`) provided contains information about movies and series available on the Netflix platform. Below is a table detailing the column names and descriptions:

| Column Name   | Description                                    |

| Cast          | Actors starring in the content                 |
| Country       | Country where the content was produced         |
| Date Added    | Date when the content was added to Netflix     |
| Release Year  | Release year of the content                    |
| Rating        | Content rating (e.g., PG-13, TV-MA)            |
| Duration      | Duration of the content (in minutes)           |
| Listed In     | Genre(s) of the content                        |
| Description   | Brief description of the content               |

Please note that the data may contain null values and outliers, but we will focus on exploring the main trends for this project.

## Objectives
